## Rest Information from Image Test App

This is a test app for the capacitor plugin Rest 
Information from Image. To use it, you need to copy or
rename data_example.json to data.json and fill out the 
information for your endpoint.

### Running this example

To run the test, you can use the `npm start` command for browser, though the plugin doesn't have browser support, so I would suggest building the app for mobile..

```bash
npm start
```
